### Why I made this project ?

Improve knowledge and practice use of json files and `pandas` library.
Practice German language.
Practice with `tkinter` library.


### How to use?

To start, you can run the main.py script from the command-line.
After a word in German and its translation appears, if you knew it, click the check button. If you did not knew, click the wrong button.
If you have checked a word, it will get removed from the pool of words to learn.
The reset button returns the known words to the initial pool of words to learn.
